# Video Player App 

This is a Video Player App developed on MERN stack.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Download Node LTS version here: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
- Download VSCode from here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
- Install both before continuing
- Download MongoDB from here <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community> don’t do anything with it just yet.

### Installing & Starting

- Open Visual Studio Code (Referred to as VSCode)
- In the left side bar, click the square icon to open the extensions menu
- Install the extensions:
  - Prettier
  - EditorConfig for VSCode
  - Visual Studio Intellicode
- In here, press Command-Shift-P on Mac, or Ctrl-Shift-P on windows, and type ‘Git Clone’ into the box that appears and hit enter.
- In the box that then comes up, enter:
<https://github.com/prashantkrverma07/video-player-app.git>
- Then press enter, then once that is done, click open in the bottom right.
- Once the project loads up, on both Mac and windows, press Ctrl-BACKTICK (the key next to the number 1 on your kb). This opens terminal and is a super useful shortcut :)

    - `cd client` and hit enter.
    - `npm install` and hit enter.

    - `cd server` and hit enter.
    - `npm install` and hit enter.
- Once that finshes, the project is ready to go :)

- Start the web page and server by typing :
    - `cd client` then ` npm start` into terminal 1.
    - `cd server` then  `nodemon` or `node app.js` into terminal 2.
- The site is now available at <http://localhost:3000/> and server is running at <http://localhost:5000/>
